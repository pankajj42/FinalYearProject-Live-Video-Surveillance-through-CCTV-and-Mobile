The Project is to build a Live Video Surveillance Platform with both web and mobile access, in which you can feed the data via cctv - dvrs and/or mobile cameras.
The deliverables for this project are:
 Media Server to handle the incoming streams and generate output streams,
along with other functionalities like saving streams in the server storage.
 Use of compression algorithm to send streams with minimum bandwidth.
 Android Application to send streams from an android device.
 Android Application to view the streams generated by the server.
 Web based portal to view all the streams.
 Web based portal to manage the system through an admin.
 GUI to start the system.
